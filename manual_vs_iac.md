Yes, you are absolutely correct. You can manually create every single resource described in the `template.yaml` file using the AWS Management Console.

The `template.yaml` is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) file. It's a blueprint that tells AWS what to build. You can follow that blueprint manually:

1.  **Go to the SQS service:** Create a new SQS queue (`RecordsQueue`).
2.  **Go to the IAM service:** Create the necessary execution roles for each Lambda function with the correct permissions (e.g., permissions to write to SQS, permissions to access the VPC for the database).
3.  **Go to the Lambda service:**
    *   Create five separate Lambda functions (`CreateRecordFunction`, `GetRecordFunction`, etc.).
    *   For each function, configure the Python runtime, upload your code (as a .zip file), and set the correct handler (e.g., `create.create_record_handler`).
    *   Attach the IAM roles you created.
    *   Set all the environment variables (`SQS_QUEUE_URL`, database credentials).
    *   Set up the triggers (SQS for the `DbWriterFunction`).
4.  **Go to the API Gateway service:**
    *   Create a new REST API (`FinanceApi`).
    *   Create the `/records` resource and a `/records/{record_id}` resource.
    *   For each resource, create the methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
    *   For each method, configure the integration to point to the correct Lambda function.
    *   Enable CORS.
    *   Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., `Prod`).

**However, there are very strong reasons why using the `template.yaml` file with SAM is the industry best practice:**

*   **Automation & Reproducibility:** You can tear down and rebuild your entire infrastructure with one command (`sam deploy`). This is perfect for creating separate development, staging, and production environments that are identical.
*   **Error Reduction:** Manual setup is prone to human error. It's easy to forget a permission, misconfigure an API endpoint, or set a wrong environment variable. The template ensures consistency every time.
*   **Version Control:** You can check your `template.yaml` into Git. This means you can track changes to your infrastructure over time, review them in pull requests, and revert to old versions if something goes wrong.
*   **Clarity & Documentation:** The template file serves as clear documentation for exactly what resources your application needs and how they are configured.

So, while you *can* do it manually (and it's a great way to learn what's happening under the hood), for any real-world project, using the IaC template is far more efficient, reliable, and professional.
